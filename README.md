## Contributing

Pull requests are more than welcome. For major changes, please open an [issue](https://github.com/maxvossel/elastory/issues) first to discuss what you would like to change or add.

## Project status

Work on this project has slowed down since I left academia for an [AI startup](https://lector.ai). I still like this project however and would be happy to help anyone using the code. I can not promise anything but will do my best to provide support. :)
